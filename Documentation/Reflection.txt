----------Week One Reflection----------

The task for this week was to build a HTML website. I built a site for GreaterAngrier, a train operating company located in the UK currently holding the East Anglia rail franchise, operated by Cherie Blair. I have implemented a modern multimedia website with videos, images and sounds. At the top of the page is a navigation menu which 'sticks' to the top as visitors scroll. Javascript has been utilised to automatically update the status on the railway in a sidebar on the homepage. The company's mascot, Tony Blair, is seen on the homepage advertising Blair Fares (discounted fares). In the footer is a copyright notice and link to operator Cherie Blair's website.

CSS has been utilised to decorate the pages, whilst an iFrame shows the train departure board for London Liverpool Street. Tickets can be purchased to/from 5 stations, linking to the National Rail website, whilst the current date/time is loaded into the form automatically, using an external javascript class called Moment.js.
